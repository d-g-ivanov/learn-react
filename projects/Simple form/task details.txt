Form:
	
- Make a submission form with the following fields:
		
	- First Name
		
	- Last Name
		
	- Email
	

- The fields should have colored borders that will change to a random color (the same for all fields, at the same time) on losing focus

- There should be a submit button
	

- Submission:
		
	- The info should be sent to an endpoint
		
	- The submit button should turn green if the response is 200
		
	- The button should turn red if the submission fails
	



Send them to an endpoint:
	
	- use https://github.com/web-steel/koa.api.skeleton for a skeleton API
	
	- If the name has less than 5 characters the submission should fail
	
	- otherwise, the submission should succeed
