Build a web application that gives information about the open issues in a given repository. 
When a user enters the GitHub Username and the repository name into the field on the Home/Main page of this application, the following is what should happen:
a.	The page will show the full list of the open issues for the given repository. 
b.	Each item in the list will:
i)	Show the title of the issue
ii)	Show the assignee of the issue
iii)	Show the assignee Profile Avatar
iv)	When clicking on an issue title, display/navigate to the comments of it
c.	When you reload the browser the inputs should hold the Username and repo name and have to display the repo as well.
i)	You can use any method you want to do the task

Design is by choice, not pre-given.
