Allow users to add work experience sections and fill them out.

Text fields should be editable and support keyboard shortcuts for bold (ctrl/cmd+b), italics (ctrl/cmd+i) and underline (ctrl/cmd+u).

Imagine there is an endpoint that validates user input and makes suggestion to improve their content.

Mock the service as follows, required only for description field:
- if user enters the phrase "I've done many projects", service should return following result, where message is a suggestion and range is whihc part of the user input the message affects:

``[
  {
    "range": [10,23],
    "message": "This is vague. Instead of “Managed projects for many clients”, say “Managed projects for 10 clients including BlueBank.”"
  },
  {
    "range": [0,23],
    "message": "Include a valuable metric if possible. For example: \"Increased revenue by 20% within one month.\"."
  }
]``

- highlight in red the ranges where improvement can be made.
- when hovering over the highlight, display a tooltip for the given message.

Track the following:
1. If user viewed the suggested correction
2. If user changed their texts after viewing the suggestion
3. If the suggestion was ignored


Designs were pre-given but I am not at liberty to share. Done 1 to 1 with requirements.
